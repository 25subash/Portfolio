          <h3>Building for Real People</h3>
        </div>
        <p>
          My work with Coryer Staffing showed me how much difference a well designed system can make. I spent time understanding how they moved information, where things slowed down, and why details were getting lost. I built automation that pulled data from different places, cleaned it up, and filled their CRM without the constant manual work. It was satisfying to see something I created save people time every single day.

          <h3>Exploring the Edges of AI</h3>
        </div>
        <p>
          At dScribe AI I worked closely with NVIDIA Jetson devices and the systems behind computer vision. A lot of my time went into getting these devices online, securing access, and making sure everything communicated properly. I liked working at this level where software, hardware, and networking all meet. It taught me how to troubleshoot calmly and understand what is really happening under the surface.

          <h3>Understanding How Systems Fit Together</h3>
        </div>
        <p>
          My work at Genworth helped me appreciate structure and clean design in data and cloud systems. I rebuilt messy SQL logic into something more organized, and I worked on pipelines that moved large amounts of information smoothly from one system to another. I also spent time in AWS, making sure their environments were backed up, monitored, and following the rules they needed to stay secure. I enjoyed seeing how each part of a system affects the whole.

          <h3>Research That Made Me Think Differently</h3>
        </div>
        <p>
          One of the most meaningful projects I worked on was my research using MobileNetV2 to classify breast cancer tumors. I trained and tested the model, explored the patterns in the data, and built a simple tool that let people try it themselves. Publishing the paper showed me how valuable it is to explain technical ideas in a way people can actually understand. It also made me appreciate the responsibility that comes with working on problems that matter to real people.
